# Facial-expression-Tracker
A Jupyter Notebook application that tracks facial expressions of figures in videos through tensor flow and python. Built and trained a convolution neural network in Keras from scratch to recognize expressions and then deployed the trained model to a web interface with Flask and applied this to real time video streams and image data.
